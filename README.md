# Fruit-Detection-Using-TensorFlow-Lite
he project involves using TensorFlow Lite for fruit detection. It includes collecting and preprocessing labeled fruit images, selecting a pre-trained object detection model, fine-tuning it on the fruit dataset, converting the model to TensorFlow Lite, and deploying it for real-time detection on mobile or edge devices.
